#R squared
""" R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that 
represents the proportion of the variance for 
a dependent variable that's explained by an independent
 variable or variables in a regression model
 
 r squared tells us how well our model is fitted to our data

 the greater and closer r^2 = 1 the better

Variance: Informally, it measures how far a set of numbers are 
spread out from their average value


"" R^2 will  never decrease even if we add variables
p= number of regressors
n= sample size

r squared vs adjusted r squared 
adjusted r squared is adjusted 
to account for the number of predictors
